# WebAutomationCSharp
This sample code demonstrates (using my version of the AuthenticationAndAccessRestrictions CherryPy web server sample) how 
to use HtmlUnit in C#.NET to automate a web browser.  Obviously, if your web service as a REST API, you would just call 
that API directly - HtmlUnit is good for when you want tto exercise the web UI directly, or if you have no REST API.
